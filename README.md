# bluejay: atmospheric photochemistry in Julia

bluejay is a 1D photochemical model for planetary atmospheres, built by Eryn Cangi and Mike Chaffin at Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, University of Colorado Boulder.

bluejay has thus far been implemented for Mars and Venus and carries the following characteristics:
- 66 neutral and ion species
- Fully coupled neutral and ion chemistry with no<sup>†</sup> required fixed background species 
  - 600+ chemistry reactions
  - Deuterium isotope chemistry for studying the D/H ratio
  - Option to hold any species density constant
  - Option to assume photochemical equilibrium for short-lived species (ions and some neutrals)
  - Easy modification of the chemical network used (just supply an Excel spreadsheet with appropriate formatting)
- Calculation of thermal and non-thermal escape of H, D, H2, and HD 
- Capability to model surface (0 km) to space (exobase/escape region, ~250 km) 
- Vertical coordinate: Altitude
- Option to use a flexible Gear method ODE solver, or built-in Julia ODE solvers<sup>‡</sup>
- Fast run time (~5-10 minutes per simulation)
- Can be run to chemical equilibrium or for shorter time periods 
- Modifiable temperature profiles
- Photochemical modeling without having to use FORTRAN ;)

Things bluejay does not do at this time:
- Use pressure as the vertical coordinate
- Solar wind interactions of any kind 
- Self-consistently calculated ion escape
- Fluid dynamics of any kind 
- Radiative transfer/thermal balance calculations (the temperature profile is prescribed)

<sup>†</sup> argon is typically held constant in the Mars model, but doesn't have to be

<sup>‡</sup> at present, the Julia ODE solvers don't seem able to handle the most complex simulations where all species densities are solved for, but can do fine with simpler atmospheres of fewer constituent molecules, or with fixed backgrounds.

## Installation 

bluejay is currently up-to-date with Julia 1.8.5. It will likely work with newer versions, but it has not yet been tested. 

At this time, there are no compiled binaries. The model is provided as a collection of modules (under the Photochemistry module) and related scripts. To install, simply ensure that Julia is installed in the location of your choice and added to your environment $PATH variable, and fork the repo. The root directory of the model must contain:

- The Photochemistry module folder
- The `uvxsect` folder
- All scripts needed to run the model, described later in Usage

### Requirements

Julia packages the model depends on:

- DataFrames
- DataStructures
- Dates
- DelimitedFiles
- DifferentialEquations
- DoubleFloats 
- GeneralizedGenerated
- HDF5
- IncompleteLU
- Interpolations
- IterativeSolvers
- JLD
- LaTeXStrings
- LinearAlgebra
- Printf
- PyPlot
- PyCall
- PlotUtils
- Revise
- SparseArrays
- XLSX
    
### Photochemistry module contents

The Photochemistry module contains several submodules:

- **AnalyzeChemAndTransport.jl**: Functions which help in analyzing the chemistry and transport of a given saved atmosphere file. Here you can compute various volume rates, timescales, the total escape, the fractionation factor, and limiting flux.
- **BasicUtilities.jl**: non-photochemistry or atmosphere specific functions. Mostly very short helper functions and string manipulation.
- **Core.jl**: The photochemical model core, including:
  - Atmospheric attribute functions (scale height, n_tot, etc) and atmospheric matrix object manipulation 
  - Escape functions
  - Chemistry functions
  - Temperature functions (per planet - should be modified for new models of new planets or other climate scenarios)
  - Transport and boundary condition functions
  - Water profile functions (modifiable with some work)
  - Photochemical equilibrium functions
- **Crosssections.jl**: Functions which load cross section data and populate the dictionary of cross sections. Note, the J rates are hard-coded in as lists of reactants and products at this time due to the many different ways they are handled. This may be improvable/automatable in the future.
- **FileIO.jl**: Anything that involves getting info out of or writing info into a file, including saving the model results and parameter logs.
- **JuliaODEsolver.jl**: Optional submodule with functions to utilize the Julia ODE solvers. Not presently used in our work as the Gear solver (included in the `convege_new_file.jl` script) works better.
- **Plotting.jl**: Functions which make plots for showing model inputs, model evolution, and results.
- **ReactionNetwork.jl**: Everything needed to ingest an Excel spreadsheet of reaction rate data and turn it into a symbolic chemical network for Julia to read. Also includes functions which calculate enthapies of reaction and modify a reaction rate spreadsheet. These functions are NOT called by the model directly and MUST be run by the user when establishing a new simulation, say, for a new planet, because escape energy changes with different gravities.
- **UnitConversions.jl**: Some basic unit conversions relevant to planetary atmospheres and water budgets.

    
## Usage

**Initial steps**:
- Ensure that the root folder contains the `Photochemistry` folder, the `uvxsect` folder, and the following scripts and files:
  - `converge_new_file.jl`
  - `CONSTANTS.jl`: True physical constants. Should never need to be changed unless adding new constants.
  - `PLOT_STYLES.jl`: Styling choices for model plots.
  - `INPUT_PARAMETERS.jl`: Parameters that the user can change before running the model. 
  - `MODEL_SETUP.jl`: Some basic model parameters that don't change much, but depend on information in INPUT_PARAMETERS.jl.
  - `{PlanetName}-Inputs/REACTION_NETWORK_{PlanetName}.jl`, reaction rate data for the chemical network. Although rate constants don't change, these files also include the enthalpy calculations for each reaction and the excess energy of that reaction above escape velocity - which DOES change per planet. These sheets must be recalculated once for any new planet used in the model.
  - `INITIAL_GUESS.jl`, an initial guess for species densities by altitude

**If modeling a new planet**:
1. Add a new folder in the model root called `(Planet)-Inputs` (without the parentheses), and a new folder one level up called `Results_(Planet)`.
2. Add planetary constants to dictionaries in `MODEL_SETUP.jl` for the planet in question. If you change any variable names, make sure to Ctrl-F replace them all submodules of Photochemistry. Variables to update include: `M_P`, `R_P`, `DH`, `sol_in_sec`, `season_in_sec`, `g`, `SA`, `hygropause_alt`, `zmin`, `zmax`, `Texo/Tsurf/Tmeso` options, and there may be more I've missed but hopefully not.
3. Use `scale_solar_spectrum.py` (Python, not Julia) to scale the solar min/mean/max spectra to the orbital AU appropriate to your chosen planet. If using for exoplanets, please provide your own solar spectrum in final units of photons/s/cm^2/nm.
4. Run `modify_rxn_spreadsheet` (from the `ReactionNetwork.jl` submodule) at the command line so that enthalpies of reaction will be re-calculated and saved to a new REACTION_NETWORK spreadsheet. WARNING: If you don't do this, non-thermal escape fluxes will NOT be physical!
5. Dig into the module and change these deeply buried things:
  - `Keddy()` (eddy diffusion profile)
  - Temperature profile: currently handled separately for each planet; make sure to change the call in `MODEL_SETUP.jl` also.
  - Water profile handling
  - `escape_probability()`: This will require new parameters for H and D escape that need to be calculated in a Monte Carlo particle transport model. Currently in May 2024 Bethan Gregory is responsible for this.
6. You will need to generate a new initial guess of the atmosphere and feed it in as (e.g.) `INITIAL_GUESS.h5` You can use any method to do this. Suggestions include: Set the principal component of the atmosphere (e.g. CO2 on Mars) to be a constant value roughly what it is at the surface, and zero out all other species and let the model build them up; collect numbers from existing published works and use those.
7. If you need to remove any species that aren't relevant, delete these from `orig_ions` and `orig_neutrals`, and ensure your initial guess file doesn't contain any profiles for them.

**If adding new chemical species**:
This list may be incomplete. If you discover a necessary step that isn't written here, please open a Github issue.
1. Add the species' mass in amu to the `molmass` dictionary in `CONSTANTS.jl`.
2. Add entries for the new species to `speciescolor` variable in `PLOT_STYLES.jl`
3. Add the species to the `species_groups` variable in PLOTTING / `plot_atm()`
4. Add the species to either `new_neutrals` or `new_ions` variables in `INPUT_PARAMETERS.jl`.
5. Set `adding_new_species` variable in `INPUT_PARAMETERS`.jl to true
6. If you want to provide a non-zero initial guess profile for the species, set `use_nonzero_initial_profiles` to true in `INPUT_PARAMETERS`.jl, and enter the initial guess in a file with path (relative to the code directory) equal to `../Resources/initial_profiles/{speciesname}_initial_profile.txt`. 
7. Add related bimolecular/termolecular chemical reactions to the appropriate spreadsheet (e.g. `REACTION_NETWORK_{PlanetName}.jl`).
8. For any new photodissociation/photoionization reactions including the new species:
  - Add the reactions under the Photodissociation and Photoionization tabs in the reaction network spreadsheet, setting their status to 'New' for the first run.
  - Obtain the cross sections for each reaction as a function of wavelength, binned in half-integer steps (0.5, 1.5, 2.5 etc nm), and save as a .csv or .dat file in the `uvxsect` folder with the symbolic representation of the reaction as the filename (e.g. JH2OtoH2pO1D; where p means a regular plus sign and pl means a superscript plus for ions).
  - Add the reactant and product lists to the `reactant_product_sets` in `Crosssections.jl` under the `populate_xsect_dict()` function.
9. Add the enthalpies of formation of the species to the spreadsheet `Enthalpies_of_Formation.xlsx`, using one of the existing sources in the spreadsheet or any reputable database.
10. Converge a new atmosphere with the new species. Once successful:
  - Save the output `final_atmosphere.h5` as the new initial guess file for that planet
  - Set the newly introduced photodissociation/photoionization reactions to "Conv" in the "Status" column of the appropriate tabs within the reaction network spreadsheet
  - Set `adding_new_species` variable in `INPUT_PARAMETERS`.jl to false.
  - Move the new species' symbols to the "`conv`" lists in `MODEL_SETUP.jl`.


**Running the model**:
1. Modify `INPUT_PARAMETERS.jl` to your chosen conditions for the simulation. 
2. At the command line, navigate to the model root folder and run `julia converge_new_file.jl`.

## Name

Mike thought that a bird-themed naming scheme would be fun. He suggested "Sparrow" for this model, combining "[chemical] species" + "arrow" to signify the motion of species vertically through the atmosphere. I pointed out that "Jay" would be a much punnier name (the reaction rates of photochemical processes are referred to as "J rates", also the model is written in Julia, which starts with J), and Mike pointed out that Jay is also a general name so it may be confusing. The bluejay is well recognized as a bird, and has a short and easy to remember name. I hope to make a pretty logo soon.
