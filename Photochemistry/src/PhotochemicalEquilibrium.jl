    Input:
        possible_solns: An array of possible densities for each species being solved for. 
                        If P-L=0 is linear in the species density, the solution is in 
                        column 1 of possible_solns. If quadratic, there are two solutions
                        in columns 1 and 2 and 3 possible cases:
                            - Both solutions are positive, and we use the one that minimizes the 
                              change in density from the previous state
                            - Both solutions are negative, in which case we set the density to 0
                            - There is a positive and a negative solution, in which case we use
                              the solution that minimizes the change in density from the previous
                              state and also sets the negative value to 0 if that's the chosen one.

                        has occurred.
