    #=
    Here's a weird one. The atmospheric density matrix stores values for each
    species (column of the matrix) at each altitude (row of the matrix) of the atmosphere. 
    This means there are num_layers (124 for a 0-250 km grid) rows. But, a lot of our
    functions like Keddy, Dcoef, and so on need to be evaluated at alts 0 through 250 km, or at
    num_layers+2 (126 for 0-250 km grid) altitudes, AND they depend on the atmospheric density dictionary,
    which is only defined for num_layers altitudes. That means that to calculate Keddy etc. as
    vectors, we need to "duplicate" the first and last entries in the atmospheric density matrix,
    i.e. we put a "fake" density in at alt = 0 and alt = 250 km which is the same as the 
    densities at alt = 2 km and alt = 248 km, respectively. 
    
    In the non-vectorized version, Keddy etc. get the atmospheric density at the boundary layers
    by using n_alt_index, which uses clamp, and maps alt=0 => i=1, alt=2 => i=1, alt=4 => i=2...
    alt=248 => i=124, alt=250 => i=124. 
    
    So this does the same thing but as an array.

TRANSPORT DESCRIPTION 

at each level of the atmosphere, density can be transferred up or
down with a specified rate coefficient.

                         | n_i+1
      ^  tspecies_i_up   v tspecies_i+1_down
  n_i |
      v tspecies_i_down  ^ tspecies_i-1_up
                         | n_i-1

the flux at each cell boundary is the sum of the upward flux from
the cell below and the downward flux of the cell above. These fluxes
are determined using flux coefficients that come from the diffusion
equation. Care must be taken at the upper and lower boundary so that
tspecies_top_up and tspecies_bottom_down properly reflect the
boundary conditions of the atmosphere.

This is handled in the code with the population of the appropriate
reactions, with variable rate coeffecients that are populated
between each timestep (similar to the way photolysis rates are
included). We need to make reactions at each interior altitude
level:
         n_i -> n_i+1  tspecies_i_up
         n_i -> n_i-1  tspecies_i_down

At the upper and lower boundary we omit the species on the RHS, so
that these reactions are potentially non-conservative:

        n_top    -> NULL  tspecies_top_up
        n_bottom -> NULL  tspecies_bottom_down

These coefficients then describe the diffusion velocity at the top
and bottom of the atmosphere.
=#

function binary_dcoeff_inCO2(sp, T, globvars...)
    #=
    Calculate the bindary diffusion coefficient for species sp, b = AT^s.

    Currently, this is set up to only work for diffusion through CO2 since that's the Mars atm.
    Could be extended to be for any gas, but that will require some work.
    =#   
    A = diffparams(sp)[1] .* 1e17 # Empirical parameter (determined it by experiment)
    s = (diffparams(sp)[2]) # Empirical parameter (det. by exp.)
    b = A .* T .^ s # T = temperature
end

function boundaryconditions(fluxcoef_dict, atmdict, M; nonthermal=true, globvars...)
    #= 
    Inputs:
        fluxcoef_dict: a dictionary containing the K and D flux coefficients for every species throughout
                       the atmosphere. Format species=>Array(length(all_species), length(alt)).
                       Because it has length alt, it ALREADY INCLUDES boundary layer info in the 
                       1st and last elements. 2nd and penultimate elements are for the edge bulk layers.
        atmdict: Atmospheric state dictionary, required for the nonthermal escape boundary condition.
        M: total atmospheric density, required for the nonthermal escape boundary condition.
    Outputs:
        boundary conditions for species in a 2 x 2 matrix, format:
        [n_1 -> n_0, n_0 -> n_1;      
         n_(nl) -> n_(nl+1), n_(nl+1) -> n_(n_l)]

        where n_0 is the boundary layer from [-1 km, 1 km], n_1 is the first bulk layer from [1 km, 3 km],
        n_(nl) is the topmost bulk layer, and n_(nl+1) is the top boundary layer.

        Form of the output is:

         Surface [↓, ↑;     [density-dependent, density-independent;    [#/s, #/cm³/s.;
         Top      ↑, ↓]      density-dependent, density-independent]     #/s, #/cm³/s]

        Each row has two elements:
            1st element: n_bulk  -> NULL (depends on species concentration in bulk layer)
            2nd element: NULL -> n_bulk (independent of species concentration in bulk layer)

            note, technically, these are chemical equations.

        More specifically, when the return value of this function is used in other functions, the first
        element in each row will eventually be multiplied by a density taken from the atmospheric 
        state dictionary, and the second element will be used as-is. That way, eventually the total
        change recorded in other functions is always #/cm³/s. 

        FROM VENUS VERSION, MIKE:
        Sign convention: The density-dependent terms (bc_dict[sp][:, 1]) are multiplied by -1 when the

#=
molecular diffusion parameters. value[1] = A, value[2] = s in the equation
D = AT^s / n given by Banks & Kockarts Aeronomy part B eqn. 15.30 and Hunten
1973, Table 1.

molecular diffusion is different only for small molecules and atoms
(H, D, HD, and H2), otherwise all species share the same values (Krasnopolsky
1993 <- Hunten 1973; Kras cites Banks & Kockarts, but this is actually an
incorrect citation.)

D and HD params are estimated by using Banks & Kockarts eqn 15.29 (the
coefficient on T^0.5/n) to calculate A for H and H2 and D and HD, then using
(A_D/A_H)_{b+k} = (A_D/A_H)_{hunten} to determine (A_D)_{hunten} since Hunten
1973 values are HALF what the calculation provides.

s, the power of T, is not calculated because there is no instruction on how to
do so and is assumed the same as for the hydrogenated species.

function fluxcoefs(species_list::Vector, K, D, H0; globvars...) 
    #=
    New optimized version of fluxcoefs that calls the lower level version of fluxcoefs,
    producing a dictionary that contains both up and down flux coefficients for each layer of
    the atmosphere including boundary layers. Created to optimize calls to this function
    during the solution of the production and loss equation.

    Here, D and Hs depend on the current atmospheric densities, and need to be pre-calculated
    within the upper level function which calls this one.
    The parameters below which vary by species are dictionaries, and those that are arrays
    don't depend on the species. All profiles are by altitude. All lengths are the same 
    as for the alt variable (full altitude grid including boundary layers).

        species_list: Species for which to generate transport coefficients. This allows the code to only do it for
                transport species during the main simulation run, and for all species when trying to plot 
                rate balances after the run.
